		<h1> Reading reponse</h1>
		The ideas that interested me the most in this reading would be the authors thoughts on egelessness and the extension of webpages above a single shot is a statement I found very hard to explore but yet understands in a personal way. Growing up in a generation that witnessed the rapid development of technologies, there are many aspects in web designs and other electronic product designs that we take granted. The use of technology began to increase while we grow up and this aspect of our life just keeps evolving and developing. A variety of devices can to used to achieve the same task, but we often keep all of them and use them in different locations. As he points out in the article that technology in this case doesn't help us solve the problems in completing tasks, but actually creates an abundance of it. I understand this idea with a thought about how much technology can develop, or how “perfect” can any technology get. Is there a perfect device that can solve all problems and do everything we ever want? There are so many IT companies that releases similar products, hundreds of options are available when buying a phone. Is this really necessary or people should be satisfied with what already exists? In this case, I think both the human and the technology developments would take responsibility. Demand of newer and better products drives production, but production on the other hand does the same to humans. With the innovation of more convenient and developed products, thing eventually reaches a so-called “Threshold” that requires extra effort to continue developing. Using the new release for Apple’s Iphone as an example, from a consumer’s point of view, there were no longer the surprise of the release of a new phone that Iphone 6 or perhaps Iphone X has given us. But there is almost an invisible stress for companies like apple to release a new model each year. This lead me to the idea of human satisfaction and how we utilize so many tools to complete one task. Having the need for “satisfaction” is positive and negative at the same time. This thought drives creativity along with development but also becomes a pressure and an uncontrolled factor that takes over our lives. We start to view things differently after we fall into the trap of satisfaction and this in a way related back to the mention of Chinese Buddhism and how we should take a step back into what we do in life. Quoting him on his idea of “dropping your heavy preconceptions and revitalize a practice by finding new ways to look at it”. Maybe taking a step back in all the human satisfaction and other elements of “control” over technology-based needs would bring out new thoughts to how we view these things.
