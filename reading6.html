		<h2>Building Nonlinear Narratives for the Web by Senongo Akpen</h2>

		<text> 
In many ways, Nonlinear Narratives are able to build a more dynamic and interactive experience for the audience. Rather than telling a story through a  sequenced way, this allows more freedom in how things can be utilized on the web. To create non linear narratives, more tools and formats can be used. For example, pop up windows and other elements such as hover effects can be added freely to promote a more fun and interactive way of presenting a story. Specific to the scope of story telling, nonlinear narrative can present a more straightforward information towards the reader. One example i can think of would be the ability to review and re-look at characters who appeared in the book. This makes the plot easier to understand in some circumstances and is more convenient than a linear narrative. The invention of hyperlinks in a way effected this as it holds a similar idea in presenting information through a parallel way. The connection between each individual narrative( or plot) are created through various ways of using hyperlinks as the basis for interaction and exploration. The game “Life is Strange” would be an example of non-linear narrative, where each decision affects the future plot and thus has multiple perspectives and plot created parallel to each other.
