			<h2><strong>Website 1: New York City Street Tree Map </strong></h2>
			<h3>
				New York City Street Tree Map is a website that allows its viewers to explore every street tree planted in New York City. It gives information on the location, the number, the spices and any activities that were reported on these street trees. The map is divided into smaller communities in the city and gives statistics on how many and the most common species planted in that specific area. In general, the website can be very easily navigated. The main section of the website consists of a clear map that places a dot onto every location with a tree and states the day they are planted, it looks very aesthetically pleasing and also brings a sense of satisfaction when looking at how many trees there are in the city. Personally, I think the concept of presenting an idea such as New York city’s urban forest on an online platform is a great way of creating awareness on a concept that we often unintentionally ignore in our daily lives. Things such as trees appears so common when we walk on the streets and no one really thinks about the story behind them, by exploring through this website, it enlarges something that is seemingly small into a larger concept that allows its viewers to look deeper into street trees and the city planning of New York.

 			<h2><strong>Website 2: TryingTrying.com </strong></h2>
			<h3> 
				TryingTrying is more of an online based contemporary art piece rather than an informative website. The visual shows a repeating pattern of highly saturated colours and flows in an rising direction. It flows in irregular shapes with straight edges and each new colour rises up the page to cover the previous one. With a click on the page, it activates a sounds that plays throughout the whole flow of the website. This type of sounded reminded me of a documentary I’ve watched on visual illusions, where the combination of a high-pitched and low-pitched sound along with the rising visual patterns makes a single continuous sound that seems like it is rising in key, but in reality it isn’t and is only a play on the human brain. I think this website is a place that viewers would go for fun rather than a useful website that can act as a visual tool. It is not interactive and does not propose a goal to how viewers should and can react with this site.

 			<h2><strong>Website 3: The New York City Map </strong></h2>
			<h3> 
				The New York City map website is an exploration of the city presented in a very different and unique way, where it uses stationary images of places in the city and creates a conceptual idea of how the idea of location can be interpreted in a way different from traditional maps. Based on the website’s introduction, it is a documentation of the artist’s personal trip in New York since 1999. The website can be easily navigated with direction signs under the pictures, and it has a short caption that comes with the image.The images often look like they are randomly taken to reflect the photographer’s surroundings, the are presented in a very casual way unlike a well edited picture. It puts the viewers into the sight of the picture taker as it gives a feeling that it is putting the true reality into the frame rather than an artificially produced picture of only the good or bad sites within New York.
