		<h1>Reading response: Octavia Butler & Sam Delany at MIT, 1998</h1>

		<h2><strong>What are the advantages and disadvantages of developing communication methods for limited audiences? This can address the use, misuse, or lack of use of written language, technology, or visual design as forms of communication.</strong></h2>

		<h3>Methods of communication varies between platform and audiences where strong senses of literacy are no longer important in all places. The usage of websites the changes in formatting in books has altered how human’s read in the past years. The increase amount of pictures and visuals in all kinds of books and cites are there to make writings more comprehensive as it provides a visual aid in addition to the text. Visualizing a specific concept is one of the most natural ways for us to learn. Before the invention of written language, people relied on visuals to record and present ideas, this includes early discoveries of cave paintings, ritual performances and drawings that recorded events in the past without the use of text. The argument imposed on how literacy build up communication in a way isn’t so valid today as there are other possible ways to exchange and provide information on things. As Butler questioned the future of reading and writing due to the wide spread usage of audio, Burstein answered with the idea of television and radios being a better communicator of ideas as less processing/decoding required when it comes to absorbing information. But since visuals seemed to be way more effective than text, can these elements replace the existence of text in society? The answer in my opinion will stay the same in both 1998 and 2019, no, it can not and even if it does, written language will be reinvented after a short period of time. Just as what Craig McDonough has said, the people who can write and read are the ones who are able to control the information flow. The current basis of communication is built up through literacy. On my personal view, the spoken language is heavily affected by the written language. Reading, writing and speaking cannot develop without the aid of each other. Reading is based on the existence of writing while speaking requires both to form an idea into spoken words. Without the idea of literacy and a proper written language, our society would change as concepts and ideals about our perspectives today are often built up upon texts. This long term impact of the invention of text would never instantly disappear due to the appearance of another form that replaces this one.  </h3>

		<h2><strong>As so-called “digital natives”, where do you see literacy (of language, image, culture, tech, etc.) valued and/or devalued on the Web or amongst users of the Web? Are there notable advantages or disadvantages of any perceived shifts in recent years?</strong>></h2>

		<h3>Statements relating to the idea of loosing texts before the 21st century such as the raise of popularity in website games and programs from a todays point of view are unrealistic as they are often based on literacy. Without literacy, many things cannot be produced as a universal language has to exist for things such as TV and audio to be developed. Its so valued it is simply irreplaceable. This statement can be made with even more confidence today as our main sources of receiving information, through the internet, is most often developed by code. Which although is it different from written and spoken language, is created with a universal language that allows communication to happen around the world. In addition to this, people rely even more on text today as the internet has became a bigger part of our lives than before. In our society, the general conversation often happens online rather than having physical verbal conversation in real-life, without the ability to comprehend text and literal information, one simple cannot communicate with the efficiency provided today. The expansion of the entertainment industry (including movies, games etc) didn't create a negative effect in language but rather can simply be treated as alternative ways of communication that no matter in what circumstance, cannot replace literacy in the present generation. Therefore, from a personal stance, literacy is still present to us today and is definitely valued as an irreplaceable part of society. </h3>

		<h2><strong>How do you see the expanding or limiting nature of hypertext on today's Web? Do Delany's criticisms of hypertext still hold true within the modern Web and all of its growth and advancements?</strong></h2>
		<h3>Delany’s criticisms of hypertext don’t appeal entirely to the society today as online visuals and interactive activities have developed and expanded over the years. People no longer have to physically visit a location when they want to obtain basic information. Using google maps as an example, it provides a clear visualization of what the location looks like, it can even visit the interior of a building or museum. So the advancement in technologies like this provides a different experience with what they have obtained in the past. Visual interactive elements online such as visual reality provides full experience for people sense’s with the exception of physically feeling the person or space visually presented in front of that person. The ability to have a real life experience online is not always a positive factor, but in many ways it provides convenience for other. This idea of having better convenience can also be applied towards Delany’s thought on hypertext and reading. His idea of reading being an interactive process where people physically flip through parallel texts and get the enjoyable experience no longer exist for most people today. People aim for faster speed and this demand for fast-paced working in a way decreased people’s ability to explore as so much information can be easily searched and presented online with a simple click. This is a theory that is difficult to balance just as Delany states “ it’s lots of fun, but it’s not more interactive than what we had before; its less interactive” in a sense that this online experience doesn't actually create a “experience” for people who had interacted with it.</h3>

		<h2><strong>Are there any technological or societal speculations mentioned in this conversation that have come to be realized in the 11 years since these statements were made? Any that you see as irrelevant?</strong></h2>
		<h3>The idea of “misinformation” Delany mentioned is a realistic social idea we are encountering today. He stated that “misinformation tends to drive out information because of the relative simplicity and the stability of misinformation”. As mentioned before, the demand for a fast-paced life-style caused many side effects, one of these would be the overfill of short and surfaced information that in the end does not bring anything to the person reading it. This includes the idea of social media and how people do not analyze this information but simply absorb as they are so easily accessible at all times. His idea on the relationship between information spreading without contexts is also something that we often see on social media platforms. The fact that a specialist given piece of information is often pulled out its context to create something else as so many people uses the web and there are no real ways to control what type of content is given. The freedom in spreading information created opportunities for people to know more, but also know less.</h3>
