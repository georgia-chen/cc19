			<h3>Why Light Firecrackers on Chinese New Year?</h3>

In traditional Chinese culture, firecrackers were originally used to scare away evil spirits.

As the legend goes, a monster called Nian would come out to eat villagers and destroy their houses on each New Years Eve. The villagers discovered that burning dry bamboo to produce an explosive sound scared away the monster. Since then, it has become a tradition at Chinese New Year.
